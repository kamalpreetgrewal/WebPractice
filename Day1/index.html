	<h1>All About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello, world! My name is Kamalpreet. I live in Toronto. But Punjab is awesome.</p>

	<p>I love dogs and I have always had one until I moved here from back home.</p>
	<img src="https://placedog.net/600/400?id=45" alt="A cute dog.">

	<p>One of my hobbies is reading. I love to read non-fiction books now on different topics of business, biographies and learn from people's experiences and learnings. I just finished reading Becoming - an autobiography by Michelle Obama.</p>
